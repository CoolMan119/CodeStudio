# CodeStudio
A new code editor for Minecraft

# Introduction
LuaIDE is so far one of the best coding editors, but i felt like it missed a few features. CodeStudio's main goal is to have a nice coding enviroment for you to make your programs. CodeStudio will also auto-save so you will never have to worry about losing your data from a server crash again!
